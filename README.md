# Local_Real_Estate_WebScraper
This code is used in order to scrape real estate appraisal records in Virginia by county.

The plan for this project is to interweave Python and R/Shiny in order to create a front end that enables
consumers to make a better buying decision, or investors to analyze properties quickly

#Future enhancements include:
* A mortgage calculatore integrated in the front end
* Zillow integration
* Hosted at a unique web address
